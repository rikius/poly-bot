## Project Overview

**Goal:** Build a maximum-efficiency Polymarket trading bot in Rust
**Primary Focus:** Correctness FIRST, then speed
**Target Latency:** 12-30ms total (vs 1000ms+ Python baseline)
**Target Strategies:** Mathematical arbitrage, temporal arbitrage, spread capture
**Reference Implementation:** polyfill-rs optimizations (21.4% faster than baseline Rust clients)

---

## CRITICAL: Implementation Philosophy

> **Correctness before speed.** A fast bot that loses money is worse than a slow bot that doesn't.

The phases below are ordered to build a **truthful, safe system first**, then add strategies and optimizations.

- [ ] Track `accepting_orders` field per market

**Deliverable:** ✅ Real-time market data streaming + order book state (Ledger deferred to Phase 4)

---

## Phase 3: Execution Engine + Strategy Framework

### 3.1 Order State Machine

- [ ] Implement OrderState enum:
  - CreatedLocal → Signed → Submitted → Acked
  - Acked → PartiallyFilled → Filled
  - Acked → CancelPending → Cancelled
  - Any → Unknown (requires reconciliation)
  - Any → Rejected / Expired
- [ ] Enforce valid state transitions only
- [ ] Emit events on state changes for logging

### 3.2 HTTP Client (with Rate Limiting)

- [ ] Optimized reqwest client (HTTP/2, pooling, TCP_NODELAY)
- [ ] Connection pooling: 5-20 persistent connections per host
- [ ] HTTP/2 stream windows: 512KB initial stream, 1MB connection window
- [ ] DNS caching with trust-dns-resolver
- [ ] Connection warming (periodic /time requests every 30s)
- [ ] **Rate limiter: cap orders/second**
- [ ] **Track reject rate for circuit breaker**

### 3.3 Order Signing

- [ ] Private key loading (secure, never log)
- [ ] Derive signer/maker addresses
- [ ] EIP-712 domain separator + struct hash
- [ ] Sign with alloy LocalWallet
- [ ] Verify signatures locally before sending

### 3.4 Order Submission

- [ ] POST /order endpoint
- [ ] Transition state: Signed → Submitted → Acked/Rejected
- [ ] Handle error responses
- [ ] **Record rejects for circuit breaker**

### 3.5 Order Management

- [ ] Cancel order: DELETE /order/{id}
- [ ] Transition: Acked → CancelPending → Cancelled
- [ ] Cancel-all helper for shutdown

### 3.6 Circuit Breaker ✅ IMPLEMENTED IN PHASE 5

- [x] Track reject count and rate
- [x] States: Closed (normal) → Open (paused) → HalfOpen (testing)
- [x] Implement `ErrorType` classification (see 02-RUST-ARCHITECTURE.md):
  - [x] `Retryable`: ORDER_DELAYED, MARKET_NOT_READY (don't count toward threshold)
  - [x] `Expected`: FOK_ORDER_NOT_FILLED_ERROR (don't count toward threshold)
  - [x] `Fatal`: All INVALID*ORDER*\*, EXECUTION_ERROR, auth errors (count toward threshold)
- [x] Open circuit on:
  - [x] WebSocket disconnected
  - [x] Reconciliation failure
  - [x] Reject rate > 20% (only Fatal errors count)
- [x] Auto-reset after timeout (try half-open)
- [x] **Check circuit.is_trading_allowed() before every order**
- [ ] **Check market.accepting_orders before submitting orders** (Phase 6)

### 3.7 Strategy Trait + OrderIntent (NEW - Pivot Architecture)

- [ ] Define `Strategy` trait in `src/strategy/traits.rs`:
  - `fn name(&self) -> &str`
  - `fn subscribed_markets(&self) -> Vec<ConditionId>`
  - `fn on_book_update(&self, market_id, ctx) -> Vec<OrderIntent>`
  - `fn on_fill(&self, fill, ctx) -> Vec<OrderIntent>`
  - `fn on_tick(&self, ctx) -> Vec<OrderIntent>`
  - `fn on_shutdown(&self, ctx) -> Vec<OrderIntent>`
- [ ] Define `OrderIntent` struct:
  - market_id, token_id, side, price, size
  - `urgency: Urgency` (Immediate, Normal, Passive)
  - reason: String (for logging)
- [ ] Define `StrategyContext` (read-only view):
  - `&OrderBookState`, `&Ledger`, `&MarketRegistry`, `clock: Instant`
- [ ] **Strategies output WHAT they want, not HOW to execute**

### 3.8 Strategy Router (NEW - Multiple Strategy Support)

- [ ] Implement `StrategyRouter` in `src/strategy/router.rs`:
  - `register(strategy: Box<dyn Strategy>)`
  - `enable(name: &str)` / `disable(name: &str)`
  - `on_book_update()` → routes to subscribed strategies
  - `on_fill()` → routes to relevant strategies
- [ ] Priority-based conflict resolution (higher priority wins)
- [ ] **Future: per-strategy capital allocation**

### 3.9 Execution Policy (NEW - Taker vs Maker Pivot)

- [ ] Define `ExecutionPolicy` trait in `src/execution/policy.rs`:
  - `fn to_order_params(&self, intent: &OrderIntent) -> OrderParams`
  - `fn on_partial_fill(&self, intent, filled) -> PartialFillAction`
- [ ] Implement `TakerPolicy`:
  - Urgency::Immediate → FOK
  - Urgency::Normal/Passive → FAK
  - on_partial_fill → UnwindFilled (for arb) or CancelRemainder
- [ ] Implement `MakerPolicy`:
  - Always GTC
  - post_only: bool
  - on_partial_fill → KeepRemainder
- [ ] **To pivot from taker to maker: change policy, not strategy**

**Deliverable:** Successfully place and confirm a test order ($1) with full state machine. Strategy framework ready for Phase 4.

---

## Phase 4: Strategy MVP (Math Arb Implements Strategy Trait)

### 4.1 Dynamic Edge Calculator

- [ ] Implement `EdgeCalculator` in `src/strategy/edge_calculator.rs`
- [ ] Replace static ARB_THRESHOLD = 0.97 with dynamic calculation
- [ ] `required_edge = fees + slippage + partial_fill_risk + spread_penalty`
- [ ] Estimate slippage from book depth using `OrderBookState::depth()`
- [ ] Increase margin for thin books

### 4.2 MathArbStrategy (Implements Strategy Trait)

- [ ] Implement `Strategy` trait for `MathArbStrategy`:
  - `on_book_update()` → check for arb opportunity, return `Vec<OrderIntent>`
  - Uses `ctx.books.best_ask()` primitives (NOT check_arbitrage)
  - Uses `ctx.registry.filter()` for market selection
- [ ] Subscribe to 15-min binary crypto markets via `MarketFilter`
- [ ] Return TWO `OrderIntent`s for both arb legs (YES + NO)
- [ ] Set `urgency: Urgency::Immediate` for taker execution

### 4.3 Execution Flow (Strategy → Policy → Executor)

- [ ] StrategyRouter receives book update
- [ ] Routes to MathArbStrategy.on_book_update()
- [ ] Strategy returns `Vec<OrderIntent>`
- [ ] ExecutionPolicy (TakerPolicy) converts to `OrderParams`
- [ ] Executor submits both legs concurrently: `tokio::join!`

### 4.4 Partial Fill Handling (via TakerPolicy)

- [ ] If both filled equally → success
- [ ] If partial fills unequal:
  - [ ] `TakerPolicy::on_partial_fill()` returns `UnwindFilled`
  - [ ] Executor immediately sells excess at best bid
  - [ ] Accept small loss to avoid directional exposure
- [ ] If one leg fails completely with fill:
  - [ ] Unwind the filled leg immediately
- [ ] **Never hold unhedged position > 500ms**

### 4.5 Risk Limits (Hard Guardrails)

- [ ] Max notional per market
- [ ] Max total open exposure
- [ ] Max outstanding orders (e.g., 10)
- [ ] Max daily loss → stop trading
- [ ] Max partial-fill exposure

**Deliverable:** Bot executing math arb via Strategy trait with proper partial fill handling (small sizes)

---

## Phase 5: Edge Expansion (Additional Strategies)

### 5.1 MakerRebateArbStrategy (Gabagool Strategy) - NEW

- [ ] Implement `Strategy` trait for `MakerRebateArbStrategy` in `src/strategy/maker_arb.rs`
- [ ] Same arb logic as MathArb but with `Urgency::Passive` → GTC orders
- [ ] Filter to 15-min crypto markets only (where rebates apply)
- [ ] Configure `price_offset` for posting inside spread
- [ ] Configure `min_rebate_edge` (lower than taker - no fees!)
- [ ] Track rebate earnings separately in metrics
- [ ] Test alongside MathArbStrategy (both can run simultaneously)

**Key Implementation Notes:**

- Uses existing `MakerPolicy` infrastructure
- Posts limit orders slightly inside spread to increase fill probability
- Zero fees + rebates = profitable at lower edge thresholds (~1% vs ~3%)
- Lower fill rate but higher profit per trade

### 5.2 External Price Feeds (for Temporal Arb)

- [ ] Binance WebSocket connection in `src/feeds/binance.rs`
- [ ] Coinbase WebSocket connection in `src/feeds/coinbase.rs`
- [ ] Spot price aggregation in StrategyContext

### 5.3 TemporalArbStrategy (Implements Strategy Trait)

- [ ] Implement `Strategy` trait for `TemporalArbStrategy`:
  - `on_book_update()` → compare spot vs Polymarket, return `Vec<OrderIntent>`
  - `on_tick()` → check for time-based exits
- [ ] Detect mispricing windows (30-90 sec lag)
- [ ] Calculate directional conviction
- [ ] Set `urgency: Urgency::Immediate` for taker execution
- [ ] Time-based position exit via `on_tick()`

### 5.4 SpreadCaptureStrategy (Implements Strategy Trait)

- [ ] Implement `Strategy` trait for `SpreadCaptureStrategy`:
  - `on_book_update()` → detect spread dislocation, return `Vec<OrderIntent>`
- [ ] Delta-neutral position building
- [ ] Volatility compression detection
- [ ] Can use `MakerPolicy` for passive liquidity provision

### 5.5 Market Selection Scoring

- [ ] Score markets by liquidity, spread, volatility
- [ ] Use `MarketFilter` capabilities for filtering
- [ ] Strategy subscribes dynamically via `subscribed_markets()`

### 5.6 Strategy Hot-Swap Support

- [ ] Enable/disable strategies at runtime via `StrategyRouter::enable/disable`
- [ ] Graceful strategy shutdown: call `strategy.on_shutdown()` before disabling
- [ ] **Future: per-strategy capital allocation and risk limits**

**Deliverable:** Multiple strategies running via StrategyRouter, including MakerRebateArb alongside MathArb

---

## Phase 6: Monitoring & Observability

### 6.1 Latency Instrumentation

- [ ] Log timestamps for critical path:
  - [ ] WS recv → parse done → book updated
  - [ ] opportunity detected → order signed → POST sent
  - [ ] ack received → fill received
- [ ] Store p50 / p95 / p99 (not just averages)
- [ ] Track "max in last 1 min"

### 6.2 Health Metrics

- [ ] WS reconnect count
- [ ] Missed sequence / resync events
- [ ] Order reject count and rate
- [ ] Cancel success rate
- [ ] Fill ratio: filled / submitted
- [ ] Partial fill rate
- [ ] Reconciliation corrections count

### 6.3 Alerting

- [ ] Discord/Telegram webhooks for:
  - [ ] Circuit breaker opened
  - [ ] Daily loss limit hit
  - [ ] Reconciliation failures
  - [ ] Kill switch activated

**Deliverable:** Full observability with health metrics and alerts

## Phase 7: Deployment

### 7.1 VPS Deployment

- [ ] Provision VPS (AWS us-east-1 recommended)
- [ ] Apply kernel tuning (sysctl.conf)
- [ ] Configure file descriptor limits
- [ ] Set up systemd service with auto-restart

### 7.2 Testing Progression

- [ ] Paper trading mode (log-only, no orders)
- [ ] Small amount testing ($10-50)
- [ ] Gradual size increase
- [ ] Full deployment after 1 week stable

**Deliverable:** Production-ready bot with monitoring

---

## Phase 8: Optimization (ONLY AFTER CORRECTNESS)

> **Do not start Phase 8 until Phases 1-6 are stable for at least 1 week.**

### 8.1 Latency Profiling

- [ ] Instrument all critical paths
- [ ] Identify actual bottlenecks (not assumed ones)
- [ ] Optimize hot paths

### 8.2 Advanced Optimizations

- [ ] Lock-free order queue (crossbeam)
- [ ] io_uring for async I/O (Linux)
- [ ] Memory pre-allocation tuning
- [ ] CPU affinity for critical threads

**These are nice-to-have. Your bottlenecks will be IO + WS + rate limits first.**

```

### Market Selection Modes

**Mode 1: Auto-Discovery (Recommended for 15-min crypto)**

The bot automatically finds and subscribes to markets matching your criteria:

```toml
[markets]
auto_discover = true

# Market type filters
market_types = ["crypto_15min"]  # Options: "crypto_15min", "sports", "politics", "all"

# Additional filters
min_liquidity_usd = 1000.0    # Skip illiquid markets
min_spread_edge = 0.02        # Only markets with potential edge
max_time_to_resolution = 900  # 15 minutes in seconds
```

**Mode 2: Explicit Market List (For specific events)**

You specify exact markets to trade:

```toml
[markets]
auto_discover = false

# List of condition_ids to trade
explicit_markets = [
    "0x2e94bb8dd09931d12e6e656fe4fe6ceb3922bc3d6eab864bb6cd24773cf67269",
    "0x81d8e0447f946c753a1efad76eef9aa46ca33e14e86c1f50ae4377984b2d12d5",
]

# Or use market slugs (resolved to IDs at startup)
# market_slugs = ["btc-above-100k-jan-15", "eth-above-4k-jan-15"]
```

**Mode 3: Tag-Based Selection**

Use Polymarket's category tags:

```toml
[markets]
auto_discover = true
tag_ids = ["crypto", "btc"]  # From gamma-api.polymarket.com/tags
exclude_tags = ["long_term"]  # Skip these categories
```

### Bet Sizing Configuration

```toml
[sizing]
# === Fixed Sizing (Simple) ===
sizing_mode = "fixed"
fixed_bet_usd = 100.0         # Always bet this amount

# === Percentage of Bankroll ===
# sizing_mode = "percentage"
# bet_percentage = 0.02        # 2% of available balance

# === Kelly Criterion (Advanced) ===
# sizing_mode = "kelly"
# kelly_fraction = 0.25        # Use 25% of full Kelly (conservative)
# max_kelly_bet_usd = 1000.0   # Cap Kelly suggestions

# === Edge-Scaled (Dynamic) ===
# sizing_mode = "edge_scaled"
# base_bet_usd = 50.0          # Minimum bet
# edge_multiplier = 10.0       # Multiply by edge (e.g., 5% edge = $500)
# max_scaled_bet_usd = 500.0   # Cap

# === Position Limits (Always Apply) ===
max_position_per_market_usd = 2000.0   # Max exposure per market
max_total_exposure_usd = 10000.0       # Total across all positions
max_single_bet_usd = 500.0             # Hard cap per trade
min_bet_usd = 10.0                     # Below this, skip trade
```

### Strategy-Specific Configuration

```toml
[strategies]
# Which strategies to run
enabled = ["math_arb", "maker_rebate_arb"]

# === Math Arb (Taker) ===
[strategies.math_arb]
enabled = true
min_edge = 0.03              # 3% minimum (covers ~3% taker fee at 50/50)
max_position = 500.0         # Max per arb pair
order_type = "FOK"           # FOK or FAK
markets = "auto"             # "auto" or list of specific market IDs

# === Maker Rebate Arb (Gabagool) ===
[strategies.maker_rebate_arb]
enabled = true
min_edge = 0.01              # 1% minimum (no fees to cover)
price_offset = 0.01          # Post 1 cent inside spread
max_position = 1000.0        # Can be larger (longer hold)
requote_threshold = 0.02     # Requote if market moves 2%
markets = "auto"             # Only 15-min crypto (auto-filtered)

# === Temporal Arb ===
[strategies.temporal_arb]
enabled = false              # Not implemented yet
min_gap_pct = 0.03           # 3% gap between spot and market
price_sources = ["binance", "coinbase"]
```

### Runtime Controls

**CLI Flags (Override config.toml):**

```bash
# Start in paper trading mode
./polybot --mode paper

# Trade specific market only
./polybot --market 0xabc123...

# Override max bet
./polybot --max-bet 100

# Enable/disable strategies
./polybot --enable math_arb --disable maker_rebate_arb

# Dry run (log what would happen, don't execute)
./polybot --dry-run
```

**Hot Reload (While Running):**

```bash
# Reload config without restart
kill -HUP $(pgrep polybot)

# Or via control file
echo "reload" > /tmp/polybot_control
```

**Kill Switch:**

```bash
# Immediate stop
touch /tmp/polybot_kill
# Or
export POLYBOT_KILL=1
```

### Example Configurations

**Conservative Starter (Recommended):**

```toml
[general]
mode = "paper"  # Start with paper trading!

[markets]
auto_discover = true
market_types = ["crypto_15min"]

[sizing]
sizing_mode = "fixed"
fixed_bet_usd = 50.0
max_position_per_market_usd = 200.0
max_total_exposure_usd = 1000.0

[strategies]
enabled = ["math_arb"]  # Start with one strategy

[strategies.math_arb]
min_edge = 0.04  # Higher threshold = fewer but safer trades

[risk]
max_daily_loss_usd = 100.0
```

**Aggressive (After Validation):**

```toml
[general]
mode = "live"

[markets]
auto_discover = true
market_types = ["crypto_15min"]

[sizing]
sizing_mode = "kelly"
kelly_fraction = 0.25
max_single_bet_usd = 1000.0
max_position_per_market_usd = 5000.0
max_total_exposure_usd = 20000.0

[strategies]
enabled = ["math_arb", "maker_rebate_arb"]

[strategies.math_arb]
min_edge = 0.03

[strategies.maker_rebate_arb]
min_edge = 0.01

[risk]
max_daily_loss_usd = 1000.0
```

### Monitoring Dashboard Values

The bot exposes these metrics for monitoring:

```
polybot_markets_subscribed          # How many markets being watched
polybot_opportunities_detected      # Arb opportunities found
polybot_trades_executed            # Orders placed
polybot_trades_filled              # Orders filled
polybot_current_exposure_usd       # Total position value
polybot_daily_pnl_usd              # Today's P&L
polybot_strategy_enabled{name}     # Which strategies active
```
